                <h2>Important parts of Clair Patterson's life:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1922</strong> &ndash; Born in Mitchellville, Iowa.</li>
                    <li><strong>1939</strong> &ndash; Graduated high school at 16.</li>
                    <li><strong>1943</strong> &ndash; Graduated Grinnell College with a degree in chemistry.</li>
                    <li><strong>1944</strong> &ndash; Graduated University of Iowa with a M.A. in molecular spectroscopy.</li>
                    <li><strong>1944</strong> &ndash; Sent to work on the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago 
                        and then at Oak Ridge, Tenessee using mass spectrometry.</li>
                    <li><strong>After WWII</strong> &ndash; Returned to Chicago to get his PhD. While there he discovered interesting discoveries
                        with lead that he would study later in life.</li>
                    <li><strong>1948</strong> &ndash; Worked with George Tilton to try to figure out the age of the solar system by performing 
                        geological aging on Zircons. Tilton would measure uranium and Patterson would measure lead. 
                        Patterson discovered his samples were getting contaminated.</li>
                    <li><strong>1952</strong> &ndash; Cofounded the geochemistry program at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) 
                        with his old research advisror Harrison Brown. Patterson created his own lab focusing on keeping out any contaminations
                    in order to be able to continue his work with lead. That, combined with Caltech's new mass spectrometer greatly helped him finish his work.</li>
                    <li><strong>1953</strong> &ndash; Patterson finally had a workable sample to use and announced to the world that the age of the Earth was 4.550 billion years.
                        Which up until that point had been thought to be 3.3 billion years.</li>
                    <li><strong>1965</strong> &ndash; Patterson wrote an article &ldquo;Contaminated and Natural Lead Environments of Man&rdquo; telling the pubilc
                        of the unneccessarily high concentrations of lead in the blood streams of Americans and a large source was leaded gasoline.</li>
                    <li><strong>1965-</strong> &ndash; The Ethyl Corporation was a main producer of the lead in gasoline tetraethyllead (TEL) and 
                        fought against Patterson's findings. Their main argument stemmed from the Kehoe Rule which had found leaded gasoline safe
                        after TEL was used in a plant in 1924 where workers were becoming deathly ill from lead poisoning. Robert Kehoe became the advocate for TEL
                        Kehoe and reasoned that:
                        <aside>&ldquo;if it can be shown ... that an actual danger is had as a result...&rdquo; But, he reasoned, 
                            if it could not be shown &ldquo;on the basis of facts,&rdquo; 
                            a product this economically beneficial should not be &ldquo;thrown into the discard on the basis of opinions.&rdquo;</aside>
                        Because of this Kehoe Rule, to claim that something is dangerous, the burden of proof is on
                        those proving it is dangerous. This is the opposite to the precautionary rule which assumes something is dangerous
                        until it can be proved safe. This is why it took many years for Patterson to change the minds of the public that current leaded
                        gasoline should not be used.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>1986</strong> &ndash; All standard cars in the United States now use unleaded gasoline.</li>
                    <li><strong>1990's</strong> &ndash; By the late 1990's lead levels in the blood of Americans dropped 80%</li>
                
                    <li><strong>1995</strong> &ndash; Patterson's Death.</li>
                </ul>
